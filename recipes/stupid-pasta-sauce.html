    <title>Stupid Pasta Sauce recipe</title>
</head>
<body>
    This sauce is the epitome of a simple and is wonderfully versatile. You can use it for just about anything that calls for tomato sauce.

    Ingridients
    12 oz Cherry Tomatoes Recommend: Nature Sweet Brand "Glorys"
    1 1/2 Tbl Garlic, minced Recommend: Use fresh garlic (not pre-cut in a jar)
    4 Tbl Extra Virgin Olive Oil Recommend: Lucini Brand
    A little less than 1/2 tsp Salt Recommend: Kosher salt
    A little less than 1/4 tsp Freshly Ground Black Pepper

    Instructions:

    1. Peel and mince fresh garlic and set aside.
    2. Wash the tomatoes, then cut each tomato in half.  Set aside.
    3. Place a frying pan or sauce pan on your stovetop and add the extra virgin olive oil to it.  Next, turn on heat to medium. Note:  I use a 10 inch, nonstick frying pan when I make this sauce.
    4. Heat oil for 2-3 minutes, then add the minced garlic.  Cook garlic in oil stirring frequently for ~1 to 1.5 minutes. Note:  Watch this step closely because garlic can burn quickly!  If it does burn, you are better off throwing it out and starting over because burnt garlic will ruin the flavor in this dish.  
    5. When the garlic is cooked, add the cut-in-half tomatoes to the oil and garlic.  Stir to incorporate.  
    6. Add salt and freshly ground black pepper to tomatoes, then stir again to incorporate.
    7. Continue cooking the tomatoes for ~19-20 minutes, stirring occasionally.  *If using red pepper flakes, add them about halfway through the cooking period.
    Note: Make sure that you stir occasionally - don't walk away from the sauce for a big chunk of the cooking period. Also, if the pan starts looking like it is getting too hot, trun down the heat to between medium and medium-low.
    8. The sauce is now done!
